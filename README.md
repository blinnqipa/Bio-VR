## Information
This application contains information about DNA structure, particularly displays DNA, Chromosome, Introns, Exons, and basic building blocks of DNA, nucleotides. The application consists of three different stages/scenes:
### Zoom scene 
Used to display the DNA, Chromosome, Introns, Exons and Nucleotides in a 3-D space. Contains a button to switch to Cell Division Scene while viewing Chromosome.

### Cell Division scene
Used to display the Cell Division as an animation and read extra information about the Cell Division phases.

## Steps
We divided the project into two parts:
+ ### Modelling with blender
  
    Learning the basics of blender, and building the DNA, Chromosome, Introns, Exons, Adenine Guanine, Cytosine and Thymine in blender and then importing these objects as assets to use with Unity game engine.
+ ### Building the scenes with Unity 3D game engine and C# programming language
  Learning the basics of Unity 3D, getting used to the syntax of C# programming language to write custom scripts to control the objects found in the Unity scenes.
